**Problem Statement:**
                  Privacy is a big problem in this century. Without any encryption mechanism, we have created a high secure chatting application using several languages such as python, html, js , css, etc.,. Our primary goal is to create a secure multiple chat rooms within a Wi-Fi network that will be able to chat and can even send and receive any type of file formats.
We have created an application that can be able to work on ‘n’ number of computers within a Wi-Fi network. We have achieved this by implementing both HTTP server and TCP server.

**Procedure:**

**Server side:**

1.	Find your IPv4 address of your current network and ensure that the persons who want to chat are inside that network.

2.	Run the HTTP server program (python).

3.	Ensure that the host address and IP address of your server are correct.

4.	Run server.py (python) which contains the TCP server programming part.

5.	This server.py will wait for the client’s connection.

6.	Once the connection is achieved, The server will keep track of the clients who are connected and disconnected.

**Client side:**

1.	Open any browser and type the host address, port number, filename in the format given below,
192.168.88.172:8080/bio.html

2.	There will be a login page in which the user needs to enter the correct password --->" codered ".

3.	After that, there will be a Capcha Verification, then the home page of ‘ChatsApp’ is displayed.

4.	In the home page, there will be a download button at the bottom. The client chat program will be installed after clicking it.

5.	Open the installed file, Now you will see another login page requesting for username and Group ID.

6.	You can create your own group by creating new group ID or you can join in the existing ones.

7.	After your login, you can be able to do send group messages or you can even send a file to multiple clients/users.

**Output:**
